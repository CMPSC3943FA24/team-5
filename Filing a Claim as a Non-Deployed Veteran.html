        <h2>Can You File a Claim if You Were Never Deployed?</h2>
        <p>Yes, even if you were never deployed, you can still file a claim for a disability rating. If you received a diagnosis while on active duty, you are entitled to seek VA disability compensation for that condition.</p>
        
        <h2>Requirements for Filing a Claim</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diagnosis Received During Active Duty:</strong> You must have been diagnosed with a condition while serving on active duty.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Connection:</strong> The diagnosis must be linked to your military service, even if it did not occur in a combat or deployment situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Records:</strong> Provide medical documentation from your service records that support your diagnosis and its relation to your time in service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to File Your Claim</h2>
        <p>To file a claim for a diagnosis received during active duty, follow these steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather all medical records related to your diagnosis and treatment while on active duty.</li>
            <li>Complete the <a href="https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-526ez/" target="_blank">VA Form 21-526EZ</a> â€“ Application for Disability Compensation.</li>
            <li>Submit your claim through the <a href="https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage" target="_blank">eBenefits portal</a> or mail your application to the VA.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to Expect After Filing</h2>
        <p>Once your claim is submitted, the VA will review your medical records and service connection. If approved, you will receive a disability rating that reflects the severity of your condition and its impact on your daily life.</p>
