    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>Detailed Explanation of 38CFR</h2>
        <p>
            The Code of Federal Regulations (38CFR) is the official documentation of rules and regulations governing VA
            disability claims. It outlines the requirements for various conditions, the types of evidence necessary, and
            how disabilities are rated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Veterans can use 38CFR to understand how their disability claim is evaluated and what additional evidence
            might strengthen their case in an appeal. Key sections of the 38CFR focus on conditions like Tinnitus, PTSD,
            Hearing Loss, and more, commonly involved in denied claims.
        </p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide for Using 38CFR</h2>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 1: Locate Relevant Sections of 38CFR</h3>
            <p>
                Use <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-38" target="_blank">this link to access the full 38CFR</a>.
                Identify sections based on your specific condition. Look for evidence requirements for claims related to
                Tinnitus, PTSD, etc.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 2: Interpret Criteria for Evidence</h3>
            <p>
                Review the medical evidence required, such as doctor's reports or new medical statements.
                Focus on the specific symptoms and conditions mentioned in the 38CFR and see if your documentation aligns.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 3: Use Key Terms</h3>
            <p>
                Search for terms like "disability rating," "symptoms," or "evidence" in 38CFR to identify any gaps in your initial claim submission. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Examples of Appeals with Supporting Evidence</h2>
        <p>
            Here's an example: A veteran had a PTSD claim denied because of insufficient evidence. After reviewing 38CFR,
            they realized they needed a more detailed medical report. They provided an updated psychiatric evaluation and
            had their claim approved on appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another veteran with a hearing loss claim identified in the 38CFR that an audiogram was missing in the initial
            submission. Adding this evidence strengthened their case.
        </p>
