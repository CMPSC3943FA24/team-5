        <h2>Intent to File Disability Claim</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>What is an Intent to File?</strong> The intent to file form helps veterans lock in an effective date for their disability claim while gathering supporting documents and evidence. This allows them to potentially shorten the wait time for compensation once the claim is fully submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            By submitting an intent to file, veterans have up to one year to gather necessary evidence and complete the full claim process without losing the original filing date. This is particularly helpful for veterans who need more time to compile medical records, service documents, or other required information.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Submit an Intent to File</h3>
        <p class="centered-text">Veterans can submit their intent to file in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Online through the <a class="small-text" href="https://www.va.gov">VA's eBenefits Portal</a>.</li>
            <li>By mail using <strong>VA Form 21-0966</strong>, which can be <a class="small-text" href="https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-21-0966/" target="_blank">downloaded here</a> and sent to the VA at:</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="centered-address">
            <strong>
                Department of Veterans Affairs<br>
                Evidence Intake Center<br>
                P.O. Box 4444<br>
                Janesville, WI 53547-4444

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>In person at any VA Regional Office.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Documents Needed</h3>
        <p>
            At the time of filing the intent to file, no specific supporting documents are required. However, veterans will need to gather necessary documents before submitting the actual claim. For a comprehensive guide on the evidence needed for specific claim types, please refer to this link:
            <a class="small-text" href="https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/">Evidence Needed for Your Disability Claim</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps After Submission</h3>
        <p>
            After submitting the intent to file, veterans should begin gathering necessary evidence, such as medical records, service records, and proof of identity. The full claim must be submitted within one year to maintain the effective date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the complete claim is submitted, the VA will process the claim and determine eligibility for benefits based on the evidence provided.
        </p>

        <h3>Helpful Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a copy of the intent to file form for your records.</li>
            <li>If you are filing online, ensure you receive a confirmation notice.</li>
            <li>Be sure to file the full claim within the one-year period to keep your effective date.</li>
        </ul>
